# SmiteRandomizer
  This program will allow users to randomly select characters to play as in the game of Smite. This program can also filter the 
  selection based on class, and unwanted characters can be filtered out manually.

## Instructions: 
  Extract the zip file and place the SmiteRandomizer folder wherever you want it to be. All necessary files for keeping the program 
  up to date are within SmiteRandomizer/Resources. Run the program with SmiteRandomizer.exe.
  
## Updating:
 The Resources folder can be downloaded separately from the rest of the program and will be updated whenever necessary. Just replace 
 the folder and make sure it stays within the SmiteRandomizer folder.
 
## Other:
 If you wish to update/modify any resources yourself, God information can be found
 in SmiteRandomizer/Resources/info.txt. They don't need to be in alphabetical order, that is only for the sake of organization. However,
 the format of 'Name,Class' must be followed (no spaces before/after commas), or else the program will break whenever that
 god is chosen. All images are located in SmiteRandomizer/Resources/images. When adding/changing images for gods, follow the format of
 'T_***GOD NAME***_Default_Icon.png'. This file must be 128x128px, and the god name in the image file must exactly match the god name in
 info.txt. 128x128px Default images at can be found from https://smite.fandom.com/wiki/Gods
